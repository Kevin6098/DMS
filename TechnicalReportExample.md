EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This Industry Matching Programme (IMaP) project was undertaken through a strategic collaboration between Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) and Jasmiza Solution Sdn. Bhd. (JSSB) to address critical challenges in sales capability management faced by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) operating in a rapidly digitalising business environment. The project focuses on the design, development, and validation of a CRM-based Sales Capability System that integrates analytics and capability-based principles to transform fragmented sales competencies into a structured organisational capability. In today’s competitive and customer-centric marketplace, sales capability has evolved beyond individual sales skills to become an integrated organisational function that combines people, processes, and technology. Many Malaysian SMEs, including JSSB, continue to rely on manual and fragmented sales practices, resulting in unconverted leads, unserved customers, and unpenetrated market segments. These challenges limit sales effectiveness, reduce visibility over the sales pipeline, and constrain sustainable business growth. Within this context, the project aims to provide a practical, analytics-enabled solution that strengthens sales execution and decision-making at the organisational level. The primary objective of this IMaP project is to design and develop a CRM-based Sales Capability System that can systematically capture, manage, and analyse leads from multiple digital channels. Specifically, the project seeks to (i) understand the key challenges in developing and implementing an effective sales capability system, (ii) examine the impact of integrating data analytics into sales capability on sales performance, and (iii) explore how capability management systems support long-term sales team effectiveness and skill development. Methodologically, the project adopts an applied, design-oriented research approach consistent with IMaP requirements. A qualitative approach was employed through document analysis, industry meetings, and structured discussions with JSSB stakeholders to identify operational challenges and system requirements. These insights directly informed the development of a modular, AI-enabled CRM prototype, ensuring strong alignment between industry needs and system functionalities. The system was developed and validated at Technology Readiness Level 4 (TRL 4), demonstrating functional feasibility and technical viability in a controlled environment. The resulting Sales Capability System comprises six core modules: multi-channel lead capture, sales pipeline and opportunity tracking, task and follow-up management, reporting and analytics, chatbot management, and customer profiling and classification. Key features include centralized lead management, analytics-driven lead scoring and profiling, automated follow-up task management, role-based access control, and real-time reporting dashboards. Collectively, these features address the root causes of unconverted leads and inefficient follow-up by embedding discipline, accountability, and data-driven decision-making into daily sales operations. From an industry perspective, the system provides JSSB with a scalable and structured sales capability platform that improves lead visibility, prioritisation, and conversion potential. It enhances sales efficiency, supports targeted engagement of underserved customer segments, and strengthens managerial oversight through actionable analytics. From an academic perspective, the project contributes to applied sales management literature by demonstrating how competency-based concepts can be operationalised into organisational capability through digital systems. It also illustrates the practical integration of CRM, analytics, and simulated AI within an SME context. From a policy and national development perspective, the project directly supports MOHE’s IMaP objectives, Malaysia’s SME digitalisation agenda, and the broader goal of strengthening industry–academia collaboration. The successful development and validation of the system at TRL 4 highlight the project’s readiness for future scaling, enhancement, and potential commercialisation. Overall, this IMaP project demonstrates how applied research can deliver tangible socio-economic impact, reinforcing the role of higher education institutions as catalysts for innovation, productivity enhancement, and sustainable business growth in Malaysia.

Introduction

1.0 Research Background
In the contemporary global business environment, sales capability has become a critical determinant of organizational sustainability, competitiveness, and long-term growth. Rapid advancements in digital technologies, intensified global competition, and increasingly sophisticated customer expectations have fundamentally transformed how organizations approach sales and customer engagement. Across industries, organizations are moving away from traditional, intuition-driven sales practices towards structured, data-driven, and technology-enabled sales systems that emphasize efficiency, responsiveness, and strategic decision-making. At the global level, digital transformation has reshaped the sales function through the widespread adoption of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems, data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and omnichannel customer engagement platforms. These technologies enable organizations to systematically capture customer data, monitor sales performance in real time, and generate actionable insights that support more informed decision-making. As a result, sales capability is no longer viewed merely as the individual skills of sales personnel, but as an integrated organizational capability that combines people, processes, and technology into a coherent system.

In the Malaysian context, this transformation is particularly significant for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), which constitute the backbone of the national economy. SMEs contribute substantially to employment, innovation, and economic resilience, yet many continue to face structural and capability-related challenges in adapting to the digital economy. Despite growing access to digital platforms and online marketing channels, a large number of SMEs still rely on fragmented sales processes, manual lead tracking, and limited analytical tools. These limitations often result in inefficiencies, missed opportunities, and constrained growth potential. Sales capability, therefore, has emerged as a strategic priority for Malaysian SMEs seeking to remain competitive in an increasingly digital and customer-centric marketplace. Effective sales capability enables organizations to convert market opportunities into revenue, strengthen customer relationships, and respond proactively to changing market conditions. Central to this capability is the ability to integrate CRM systems, analytics, and digital tools into everyday sales operations.

Within this context, the Industry Matching Programme (IMaP) introduced by the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) plays a pivotal role in bridging the gap between academic knowledge and industry practice. IMaP provides a structured platform for higher education institutions and industry partners to collaborate on applied research and system development initiatives that directly address real-world business challenges. This project, undertaken through collaboration between Universiti Utara Malaysia (UUM) and Jasmiza Solution Sdn. Bhd. (JSSB), is aligned with this national agenda, focusing on the development of a Sales Capability System that integrates CRM, analytics, and capability-based frameworks to support sustainable business growth.

1.2 Industry Issues
JSSB is experiencing inefficiencies in its Sales Capability System, leading to suboptimal performance in tracking sales metrics, managing customer relationships, and forecasting revenue. As a result, sales teams struggle with alignment on targets, lack access to up-to-date customer insights, and face challenges in leveraging data analytics for informed decision-making. This inadequacy not only hampers individual and team productivity but also affects overall sales growth and customer satisfaction. Addressing these issues is crucial to enhancing sales effectiveness, improving collaboration across departments, and driving business success.

1.2.1 Unconverted Leads
The company is experiencing challenges with its sales capability system, specifically related to a high volume of unconverted leads, which indicates inefficiencies in the sales process and potential gaps in lead qualification, follow-up strategies, and customer engagement. This results in lost revenue opportunities and hinders the overall performance of the sales team. Addressing this issue requires an analysis of current sales practices, lead management systems, and the integration of analytics to optimize lead conversion rates, ensuring that potential customers are effectively nurtured and engaged throughout their buying journey.

1.2.2 Unserved customers
The company is experiencing a significant challenge in its sales capability system and has missed revenue opportunities and market penetration. This has led to a failure to effectively engage and serve a growing segment of unserved customers. This issue arises from a lack of comprehensive data analysis and customer insights, leading to insufficient targeting and outreach strategies. To address this, the company must enhance its sales enablement tools and strategies to better identify potential customers, understand their needs, and tailor offerings, accordingly, ensuring that no segment of the market is overlooked and driving overall sales growth.

1.2.3 Unpenetrated market segments
The company is experiencing challenges in maximizing sales potential due to unpenetrated market segments, resulting in missed revenue opportunities and stagnant growth. Despite possessing strong products and services, the lack of targeted strategies and insights for these segments hampers the ability to engage potential customers effectively. Addressing this issue requires a comprehensive analysis of market needs, competitive positioning, and tailored sales approaches to effectively penetrate these untapped segments and drive sustainable business growth.

1.2.4 Context of Jasmiza Solution Sdn. Bhd.
For Jasmiza Solution Sdn. Bhd., which operates in the professional training and consultancy sector, these industry issues are particularly pronounced. The organization engages with a diverse range of customers, including individual professionals, SMEs, and corporate clients, each with distinct needs, decision-making processes, and purchasing behaviors. Prior to this project, sales activities were largely managed through manual coordination and fragmented digital platforms, limiting the organization’s ability to systematically track leads, prioritize opportunities, and analyze sales performance. The absence of a centralized CRM and analytics-driven sales system constrained JSSB’s capacity to effectively convert leads and expand into underserved market segments. These challenges provided the primary motivation for the development of a structured Sales Capability System through the IMaP collaboration.

1.2.5 Key Problems Addressed by the CRM-Based Sales Capability System
The industry partner experienced difficulties in managing sales activities due to the use of multiple digital platforms for lead generation without a centralized system. Leads from social media, online advertisements, websites, and messaging applications were tracked manually, resulting in fragmented processes and limited visibility. As lead volumes increased, manual tracking led to inefficiencies, delayed follow-ups, and missed sales opportunities. To overcome these challenges, the CRM-Based Sales Capability System was developed to centralize lead management, improve follow-up efficiency, and support better lead prioritization. The key problems addressed by the system are discussed in the following subsections.

1.2.5.1 Manual Lead Tracking from Different Platforms
One of the primary challenges faced by the industry partner prior to this project was the reliance on manual lead tracking across multiple digital platforms. Leads were generated from various sources such as social media channels, online advertisements, website inquiries, and messaging applications. However, these leads were recorded and managed separately using basic tools such as spreadsheets, emails, or individual messaging threads. This fragmented approach resulted in data inconsistency, duplication of records, and difficulties in maintaining an accurate and up-to-date overview of potential customers. Manual tracking also increased the administrative burden on sales personnel, diverting their focus away from value-adding activities such as customer engagement and relationship building. As the volume of leads increased, the limitations of manual tracking became more pronounced, reducing the overall efficiency and reliability of the sales process.

1.2.5.2 Missed Opportunities Due to Lack of Centralized Lead Management
The absence of a centralized lead management system led to frequent missed sales opportunities. Without a single, integrated platform to consolidate and monitor all incoming leads, it was challenging for the organization to track the status of each lead and ensure timely follow-up. Leads could be overlooked, forgotten, or delayed due to poor visibility across the sales pipeline. In some cases, multiple sales personnel might unknowingly engage the same lead, while other high-potential leads received no follow-up at all. This lack of coordination reduced conversion rates and resulted in lost revenue opportunities. From a managerial perspective, the absence of centralized data also limited the ability to assess sales performance, identify bottlenecks, and make informed strategic decisions.

1.2.5.3 Inefficient Follow-Up and Poor Lead Prioritization
Another critical issue was inefficient follow-up practices and the lack of systematic lead prioritization. Follow-up activities were largely dependent on individual initiative and personal judgment, leading to inconsistent response times and uneven customer experiences. High-potential leads were not always distinguished from low-priority inquiries, resulting in suboptimal allocation of sales effort. Without analytical tools or lead scoring mechanisms, sales teams were unable to prioritize leads based on factors such as engagement level, urgency, or likelihood of conversion. Consequently, valuable opportunities could be lost due to delayed responses, while excessive time was spent on leads with low conversion potential. This inefficiency not only affected sales performance but also weakened customer perception of the organization’s professionalism and responsiveness.

Chapter 2
Industry & Project Background
2.0 Introduction 
Sales capability systems have become essential frameworks for organisations seeking to enhance sales performance, improve customer engagement, and remain competitive in today’s dynamic business environment. In Malaysia, effective sales capability systems typically comprise structured sales processes, competency development programmes, adoption of customer relationship management (CRM) technologies, and the integration of data analytics for informed decision-making. With rapid digital transformation and evolving customer expectations, businesses are increasingly pressured to optimise their sales processes to convert marketing leads into loyal customers, improve engagement with underserved market groups, and penetrate untapped segments. However, many organisations especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) continue to struggle with fragmented sales practices, inconsistent lead management, and limited analytical capability, which hinder their ability to respond effectively to market challenges.

2.1 Profile of Jasmiza Solution Sdn. Bhd.
Jasmiza Solutions Sdn. Bhd. (JSSB) operates within this dynamic Malaysian business environment as a professional management consulting and training services provider dedicated to driving organisational excellence and workforce capability. Founded in 2008, JSSB has established itself as a reputable firm committed to helping organisations unlock their full potential through tailored training, consulting, and operational enhancement programmes. The company’s core mission is to empower businesses to achieve sustainable growth by aligning people, processes, and strategic priorities with measurable outcomes. Over the years, JSSB has served a wide range of clients, including multinational corporations (MNCs), government-linked companies (GLCs), and SMEs across diverse sectors such as oil and gas, manufacturing, and consumer goods. 

At the heart of JSSB’s offering is its emphasis on workforce development and operational excellence. The firm delivers customised training programmes designed to enhance leadership capabilities, business acumen, and soft skills, thereby equipping teams with practical knowledge applicable to real-world organisational challenges. These programmes leverage interactive workshops, real-world case studies, and ongoing support to ensure that learning translates into tangible performance improvements. In addition to training, JSSB provides consultancy services in areas such as performance management, job design, business process optimisation, and strategic planning. Its expertise is further supported by advanced analytics solutions and proprietary tools that help organisations to better understand workforce dynamics and operational performance. 

The Principal Consultant, Jasmiza Yantee Jamalluddin, leads the firm’s strategic vision with extensive experience in human capital development, organisational psychology, and operational excellence. Her leadership is underpinned by a philosophy focused on embedding human-centric solutions into organisational systems, which drives JSSB’s commitment to sustainable organisational transformation. Under her guidance, the firm has implemented high-impact interventions that address capability gaps, enhance workforce productivity, and build strategic resilience among client organisations. 

Despite JSSB’s strengths in workforce optimisation and consulting, the company itself faces internal challenges related to sales capability, especially in managing and converting the growing volume of leads generated through various digital channels. Historically, sales activities were coordinated manually across disparate systems and platforms, limiting the organisation’s ability to systematically track leads, prioritise opportunities, and analyse sales performance. This fragmentation has constrained JSSB’s capacity to effectively convert leads, engage underserved customer segments, and strategically penetrate new market niches. Without a centralised and analytics-enabled sales system, follow-up activities have been inconsistent, and insights into customer behaviour have remained underutilised, resulting in missed opportunities and suboptimal sales performance.

The need to address these limitations provided the primary motivation for developing a structured Sales Capability System through the IMaP collaboration. This project aims to integrate lead management, customer profiling, and analytics-driven strategies into a cohesive framework that enhances JSSB’s sales execution capabilities. By doing so, the initiative seeks not only to strengthen the company’s internal sales processes but also to contribute to the wider understanding of how analytics-enabled sales capability systems can support sustainable growth among Malaysian SMEs operating in increasingly competitive and digitised markets.

2.2 Challenges of the Existing Sales System
Prior to the implementation of this project, JSSB faced several challenges associated with its existing sales system. These challenges are commonly observed among SMEs transitioning towards digitalisation and are rooted in the reliance on manual processes and fragmented digital tools. One of the primary challenges was the absence of a centralized sales management system. Leads generated from different channels such as social media advertisements, website inquiries, and direct communications were handled separately, often using basic tools such as spreadsheets, messaging applications, or individual email accounts. This fragmented approach limited the organization’s ability to maintain a comprehensive view of customer interactions and sales activities.

Another significant challenge involved inconsistent follow-up practices. Without a structured task management or reminder system, follow-up actions depended heavily on individual sales personnel. This resulted in variability in response times, missed follow-ups, and uneven customer experiences. High-potential leads could be overlooked due to workload constraints or lack of prioritization mechanisms, contributing to the issue of unconverted leads. In addition, the existing sales system lacked analytical capabilities. Sales performance data, lead conversion rates, and customer engagement patterns were not systematically captured or analyzed. As a result, management had limited visibility into the effectiveness of sales strategies, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation. Decision-making was largely reactive and intuition-driven, rather than supported by empirical data.

The absence of customer profiling and segmentation further constrained JSSB’s ability to address diverse market needs. Different customer segments, such as individual professionals and corporate clients, require distinct engagement strategies and value propositions. However, without structured data and analytics, tailoring sales approaches to specific segments was challenging, leading to underserved markets and missed growth opportunities. These challenges collectively highlighted the limitations of the existing sales system and underscored the need for a more integrated, analytics-enabled, and capability-driven solution.




2.3 Rationale for the Development of the Sales Capability System
The development of the Sales Capability System was driven by the need to address the structural and operational limitations of JSSB’s existing sales practices. Rather than focusing solely on improving individual sales skills, the project adopts a broader perspective that views sales capability as an organizational construct encompassing people, processes, and technology. A key rationale for system development is the need for centralized lead management. By consolidating leads from multiple digital channels into a single CRM platform, the organization can ensure data consistency, improve visibility, and reduce the risk of lost opportunities. Centralization enables sales teams to track customer interactions across the entire sales lifecycle, from initial inquiry to conversion and post-sale engagement. Another important rationale is the integration of analytics into sales processes. Analytics-driven insights enable organizations to prioritize leads based on urgency, engagement level, and potential value. This supports more efficient allocation of sales resources and enhances the effectiveness of follow-up strategies. For management, analytics provide a basis for monitoring performance, evaluating sales strategies, and making informed decisions aligned with organizational objectives.

The Sales Capability System also addresses the need for structured follow-up and task management. Automated task creation, reminders, and status tracking reduce reliance on individual memory and discretion, promoting consistency and accountability across the sales team. This systematic approach enhances customer experience by ensuring timely and relevant engagement. Furthermore, the incorporation of customer profiling and classification mechanisms allows JSSB to better understand and serve diverse market segments. By capturing and analyzing customer data, the organization can tailor its value propositions and engagement strategies, thereby improving market penetration and addressing underserved segments. From a strategic perspective, the development of the Sales Capability System supports organizational scalability and sustainability. As JSSB grows, a structured system provides the foundation for managing increased sales complexity without compromising efficiency or service quality. The system also aligns with broader digital transformation initiatives, positioning the organization to remain competitive in an evolving market environment.
2.4 Industry–University Collaboration (IMaP3)
The collaboration between Jasmiza Solution Sdn. Bhd. and Universiti Utara Malaysia under the Industry Matching Programme (IMaP3) represents a structured approach to addressing industry challenges through applied academic expertise. IMaP3 is designed to promote meaningful engagement between higher education institutions and industry partners, ensuring that research activities deliver tangible and measurable impact. Through this collaboration, academic researchers contribute theoretical frameworks, methodological rigor, and system design expertise, while the industry partner provides practical insights, operational context, and validation opportunities. This synergy enables the development of solutions that are both academically grounded and industry-relevant.

In the context of this project, UUM played a critical role in conceptualizing the Sales Capability System, drawing upon established theories of sales management, capability development, and digital transformation. The university team also supported the design of system architecture, module specification, and validation processes consistent with Technology Readiness Level 4 (TRL 4) requirements. For JSSB, participation in IMaP3 facilitated access to structured problem-solving approaches and analytical tools that may not have been readily available internally. The collaboration enhanced organizational learning, capability development, and readiness for future system enhancement and commercialization.
From a policy perspective, this industry–university collaboration exemplifies the objectives of IMaP3 in strengthening the socio-economic impact of higher education. By addressing real industry needs, enhancing SME competitiveness, and supporting digital innovation, the project reinforces the role of IMaP3 as an effective mechanism for translating academic knowledge into practical value.
 
Chapter 3
Literature Review & Conceptual Framework
3.1 Introduction
This chapter reviews the relevant literature underpinning the development of the Sales Capability System and establishes the conceptual framework guiding this IMaP3 project. The literature review focuses on four key areas: the concept of sales capability, the distinction between competency and capability, the role of Customer Relationship Management (CRM), analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI) in sales, and the integration of these elements into a coherent conceptual framework aligned with the objectives of the Industry Matching Programme (IMaP3). The purpose of this chapter is twofold. First, it provides a theoretical foundation that justifies the design and development of the Sales Capability System. Second, it demonstrates how existing theories and empirical insights are translated into an applied system solution that addresses real industry challenges faced by JSSB. Through this synthesis, the chapter bridges academic perspectives and industry practices in line with the applied research orientation of IMaP3.

3.2 Sales Capability Concept
Sales capability is widely recognized in the literature as a critical organizational capability that enables firms to achieve superior sales performance and sustain competitive advantage. Unlike traditional views that focus primarily on the skills and behaviors of individual salespeople, contemporary research conceptualizes sales capability as a multidimensional construct encompassing people, processes, and technology. From a strategic management perspective, sales capability represents an organization’s ability to systematically generate, manage, and convert sales opportunities into value. It involves coordinated routines, standardized processes, and supporting systems that enable consistent and effective execution of sales activities. This capability-based view emphasizes that sustainable sales performance is not solely dependent on individual talent but on the organization’s capacity to deploy and integrate resources effectively.

Empirical studies suggest that firms with well-developed sales capabilities exhibit higher lead conversion rates, stronger customer relationships, and greater adaptability to market changes. Sales capability also enables organizations to respond proactively to evolving customer needs, competitive pressures, and technological advancements. In dynamic market environments, the ability to continuously refine sales processes and leverage data-driven insights becomes a key differentiator. In the context of SMEs, sales capability is particularly important due to resource constraints and heightened vulnerability to market volatility. SMEs often rely on informal sales practices and personal relationships, which may be effective in early stages but become insufficient as the business grows. The development of structured sales capability systems allows SMEs to scale operations, improve consistency and reduce dependency on individual discretion. For the present project, sales capability is conceptualized as an organizational system that integrates human competencies, standardized sales processes and digital technologies. This perspective aligns with the objectives of IMaP3, which emphasizes applied solutions that enhance industry capability through systematic and sustainable approaches.

3.3 Competency versus Capability
The distinction between competency and capability is central to understanding the theoretical foundation of this project. Although the terms are often used interchangeably in practice, the literature clearly differentiates between the two concepts. Competency typically refers to the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors possessed by individuals. In the sales context, competencies include communication skills, negotiation abilities, product knowledge, relationship management, and problem-solving capabilities. Competency-based approaches focus on training, assessment, and development at the individual level, aiming to enhance personal performance and effectiveness.

Capability, on the other hand, extends beyond individual attributes to encompass the collective and systemic ability of an organization to perform a particular function. Organizational capability is embedded in processes, routines, structures, and technologies that enable coordinated action. While competencies reside within individuals, capabilities reside within the organization. The literature emphasizes that strong individual competencies do not automatically translate into organizational capability. Without appropriate systems and processes, individual skills may be underutilized or inconsistently applied. Conversely, well-designed systems can amplify individual competencies by providing structure, guidance, and support.

In sales management, this distinction is particularly important. Organizations may invest heavily in sales training yet continue to experience poor performance due to fragmented processes, lack of data integration, or insufficient managerial oversight. Capability-based approaches address these limitations by focusing on how individual competencies are embedded within organizational systems. This project adopts a capability-based perspective by designing a Sales Capability System that transforms individual sales competencies into organizational capability. The system provides standardized workflows, data-driven insights, and performance monitoring mechanisms that support consistent execution of sales activities. In doing so, it aligns competency development with organizational objectives and strategic priorities.
3.4 CRM, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence in Sales
CRM systems have long been recognized as foundational tools for managing customer interactions and sales activities. Traditionally, CRM systems focused on storing customer information and tracking sales transactions. However, advances in digital technologies have significantly expanded the role of CRM, transforming it into a strategic platform for sales capability development. Modern CRM systems integrate data from multiple touchpoints, including social media, websites, chatbots, and communication platforms. This integration enables organizations to maintain a holistic view of customer interactions across the sales lifecycle. By centralizing data, CRM systems reduce information silos and improve coordination among sales teams.

Analytics further enhance the value of CRM systems by enabling organizations to extract insights from customer and sales data. Sales analytics support lead scoring, pipeline forecasting, performance measurement, and customer segmentation. These capabilities allow organizations to prioritize high-potential leads, allocate resources more effectively, and evaluate the effectiveness of sales strategies. AI represents the next stage in the evolution of sales systems. AI-driven tools enable predictive analytics, automated recommendations, and intelligent customer profiling. In sales contexts, AI can support decision-making by identifying patterns in customer behavior, suggesting optimal follow-up actions, and forecasting conversion probabilities. The literature highlights that the integration of CRM, analytics, and AI contributes to enhanced sales efficiency, improved customer engagement, and more strategic decision-making. However, the effectiveness of these technologies depends on how well they are aligned with organizational processes and capabilities. Technology alone does not guarantee improved performance; it must be embedded within a coherent capability framework.
In this project, CRM, analytics, and simulated AI features are integrated into a Sales Capability System designed to support JSSB’s sales processes. The system leverages analytics for lead scoring and customer profiling while providing a structured platform that supports consistent execution and managerial oversight. This approach reflects the applied and pragmatic orientation of IMaP.

3.5 Project Conceptual Framework
Based on the literature reviewed, a conceptual framework was developed to guide the design and implementation of the Sales Capability System. The framework integrates four key components: individual competencies, organizational processes, enabling technologies, and sales performance outcomes. At the foundation of the framework are individual sales competencies, including communication skills, relationship management, and customer engagement abilities. These competencies represent the human capital necessary for effective sales activities. The second component consists of standardized sales processes, including lead capture, pipeline management, follow-up scheduling, and performance monitoring. These processes provide structure and consistency, ensuring that individual competencies are applied systematically across the organization. The third component comprises enabling technologies, specifically CRM systems, analytics tools, and AI-based functionalities. These technologies support data integration, insight generation, and decision-making, transforming fragmented information into actionable knowledge.

The interaction of these three components gives rise to organizational sales capability, which in turn influences key performance outcomes such as lead conversion, customer satisfaction, market penetration, and sustainable business growth.
Within the IMaP3 context, the conceptual framework emphasizes applied system development and validation. The Sales Capability System serves as the operational embodiment of the framework, translating theoretical concepts into a functional prototype validated at Technology Readiness Level 4 (TRL 4). This alignment ensures that the project delivers both academic contribution and practical impact, consistent with the objectives of IMaP3 and the Ministry of Higher Education.

The lack of effective sales processes, outdated technology, and inadequately trained personnel have contributed to various issues that hinder the overall sales performance of many companies (Honeycutt et al., 2005). Specifically, research indicates that the failure to effectively store and manage lead data has increased the probability of unconverted leads (Bashaw et al., 2002), while the lack of robust customer relationship management practices has led to suboptimal customer service and retention rates (Zoltners et al., 2008). Furthermore, some companies have faced difficulties in penetrating different customer segments due to limitations in their channel selection, with the digital channel being a prime example of an area where many organizations lack the necessary capabilities (Terho et al., 2022) (Nandi et al., 2013). JJSB and similar industries are grappling with the critical challenges of managing unconverted leads, reaching underserved customers, and effectively penetrating diverse customer segments, all of which hinder their ability to optimize sales capability systems. Addressing these issues requires a strategic approach that includes enhancing lead conversion processes, understanding the unique needs of different customer demographics, and leveraging data analytics to tailor sales strategies. By doing so, organizations can improve their customer engagement, ultimately driving growth and competitiveness in the market. To address these shortcomings, a comprehensive solution is required that integrates people, processes, and technology to form a cohesive sales capability system. Previous studies showed that achieving sales success is a multifaceted endeavor that requires organizations to have the right people, tools, and systems in place (Zoltners et al., 2021). Effective sales capabilities extend beyond traditional notions of customer, product, and market and involve a holistic approach to sales management. Companies that adopt a proper sales approach and leverage different methods and tools are better positioned to succeed in the competitive market.
3.5.1 Capabilities Facets







Figure 3. 2: Three Main Facet

Capability can be understood as the integration of three main facets, namely people, systems, and tools. These three elements must function in a coordinated and complementary manner to enable an organisation to perform its functions effectively and sustainably. People represent the human competencies, skills, knowledge, and behaviours required to execute organisational tasks. Systems refer to structured processes, governance mechanisms, and technological platforms that support consistency, control, and coordination of activities. Tools, on the other hand, include the operational instruments, applications, and technologies that facilitate task execution and productivity.
The interaction between people, systems, and tools directly influences organisational performance and capability development. Performance reflects the organisation’s ability to utilise existing capabilities to achieve current objectives, while development focuses on enhancing and expanding these capabilities to meet future demands. Therefore, an organisation that aims to strengthen its functional capability must deliberately invest in a comprehensive capability management and development programme that aligns human competencies with appropriate systems and tools. This integrated approach ensures that capability is not treated as an isolated attribute but as a dynamic and continuously evolving organisational asset.

Recent research has highlighted critical factors for effective sales force digitalization. These include assembling the right team to lead the digital transformation, employing an agile approach, and ensuring the necessary organizational support is in place to sustain success. Mastering the digital transformation of sales is particularly important, as managerial and academic literature has historically provided limited guidance on this topic (Guenzi & Habel, 2020).

3.5.2 Sales System
The Sales System is developed based on system thinking and design thinking philosophies, where the framework and processes are intentionally structured to ensure scalability, reliability, and repeatability. Initially, the system is designed to be utilised by approximately 2,000 sales agents as a controlled implementation environment. Once the outcomes are validated and confirmed to be reliable, repeatable, and predictable, the system is automated and prepared for commercialisation to a broader user base in the market. This approach ensures that the sales system is not only operationally effective but also sustainable and adaptable for long-term business growth.
From a functional perspective, the Sales System integrates both marketing and sales activities within a unified funnel structure. Marketing functions focus on awareness creation and lead generation, forming the entry point of the sales funnel. These leads are then systematically transferred into the sales domain, where they are managed through defined funnel categories, namely Business-to-Consumer (B2C) and Business-to-Business (B2B). This dual funnel structure allows the organisation to cater to different customer segments while maintaining consistency in process execution.

The system supports multiple funnel types, including online channels, physical store interactions, sales agents, affiliate networks, and marketplace platforms. Each funnel type is governed by a standardised funnel process that covers key stages such as sales planning, customer acquisition, distribution and fulfilment, and customer success management. This structured funnel process ensures that customer engagement is consistently managed across different channels, reducing inefficiencies and improving conversion outcomes. To operationalise the funnel, the Sales System incorporates a Sales Canvas that serves as a strategic and executional blueprint. The Sales Canvas captures essential dimensions including customer profiles, funnel stages, sales tools, sales approaches or styles, sales competencies, anticipated challenges and rejection types, costing considerations, and return on investment. By integrating these elements, the Sales Canvas enables sales teams to align strategy with execution while maintaining visibility over performance and financial impact.

In terms of operating discipline, the Sales System is supported by standard operating procedures, internal controls, and structured checklists, such as ICOR frameworks and operational checklists. These mechanisms ensure consistency, compliance, and quality control in daily sales operations. Furthermore, the system integrates performance management mechanisms to monitor sales effectiveness, productivity, and outcomes in a measurable manner. Finally, the Sales System is reinforced by a clearly defined team structure and role distribution. Organisational structures and job descriptions are established to clarify responsibilities, reporting lines, and performance expectations. This alignment between people, processes, and systems ensures that sales capability is institutionalised rather than dependent on individual effort, supporting the transformation from individual sales competency to organisational sales capability.
 
Figure 3. 3: Integrated Sales Funnel and Sales Capability Framework for B2C and B2B Markets

Equally crucial is understanding the underpinning factors that drive sales effectiveness. Experience shows that organizations taking a traditional perspective on sales are destined to fail, underscoring the need for companies to adopt innovative approaches (Taleghani & Taleghani, 2021). By focusing on enhancing sales effectiveness, sales managers can maintain, stabilize, and improve their company's position in highly competitive markets (Taleghani & Taleghani, 2021). In a sales system, awareness and lead generation are crucial components for driving business growth. Awareness involves creating recognition for a brand or product, ensuring potential customers know about its existence and value. This can be achieved through various marketing strategies, such as content marketing, social media, and advertising. Lead generation follows, focusing on attracting and converting prospects into potential customers. Effective lead generation techniques, like targeted campaigns and partnerships, help build a qualified pipeline, ultimately leading to increased sales and revenue. Together, these elements form a foundation for a successful sales strategy. Effective sales capabilities involve three key elements: the right people, the right tools, and the right systems. Cultivating a highperforming sales team with the necessary skills, expertise, and agility to navigate evolving market dynamics is a critical first step. Equipping this team with the right digital tools and technologies to enhance productivity, streamline processes, and gain data-driven insights can further boost sales effectiveness. (Guenzi & Habel, 2020) (Zoltners et al., 2021). Finally, establishing the appropriate organizational systems, structures, and support mechanisms is essential to sustaining sales success over the long term. (Taleghani & Taleghani, 2021) By strategically aligning these three pillars people, tools, and systems organizations can unlock the full potential of their sales function and drive sustained growth and profitability. A sales capability refers to an individual's ability to effectively sell products or services to potential customers. Organizations often overlook critical factors like getting the right team to lead the sales digitalization effort, using an agile approach, and ensuring the necessary organizational support elements are in place (Zoltners et al., 2021). This capability encompasses various skills, including product knowledge, communication, negotiation, and problem-solving. Research on sales capability has identified key factors that influence an individual's sales performance, such as their personality traits, emotional intelligence, and learning style. Additionally, studies have also explored the impact of training and coaching on developing sales capability, with findings suggesting that tailored training programs can significantly improve sales performance.
3.5.3 The Overview of the Tool
Apart from using sales process funnel as the foundation of the tool, this tool will also be equipped with machine learning and Artificial Intelligence to increase the productivity of the users. The system will be fully integrated throughout the sales funnel to ensure sales results could be maximized.
 
Figure 3. 4: Integrated AI-Powered Multi-Channel CRM and Sales Capability System

AI-driven competency management systems play a pivotal role in advancing sales capabilities within B2B environments (Smith, 2024). By leveraging data analytics and machine learning, these systems identify skill gaps, tailor training programs, and facilitate continuous learning (Gladwin, 1984). This targeted approach not only boosts individual performance but also aligns team competencies with organizational goals (Ayers, 2015). Ultimately, the integration of AI in competency management fosters a more agile and effective sales force, driving improved outcomes in competitive markets (Mikalef et al., 2023).
 
Figure 3. 5: Detailed Sales Process Funnel from Sales Readiness to Customer Loyalty Management

In this study, the Sales Capability System is designed to leverage the "Sales Process Funnel," a widely recognized model in sales management that outlines the key stages of the customer acquisition journey, from lead generation to closed sales (Terho et al., 2022) (Quach & Weaven, 2019). In addition to using the Sales Process Funnel as a foundational framework, the proposed Sales Capability System will also incorporate machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance the productivity and efficiency of sales professionals. By integrating these advanced technologies throughout the sales funnel, the system aims to maximize sales results and improve the overall effectiveness of the sales organization.
3.6 Conclusion
This chapter has reviewed the key theoretical concepts underpinning the Sales Capability System and presented the conceptual framework guiding the project. The literature highlights the importance of viewing sales capability as an organizational construct that integrates competencies, processes, and technology. The distinction between competency and capability underscores the need for system-level solutions rather than isolated training initiatives. The integration of CRM, analytics, and AI emerges as a critical enabler of modern sales capability, particularly for SMEs seeking to enhance efficiency and competitiveness. By aligning these insights with the objectives of IMaP3, the project’s conceptual framework provides a robust foundation for the system development and methodological approach presented in the subsequent chapters.

Table 5. 2: Field to Capture for Lead Management

1. Introduction to the Concept of CRM Data Dictionary in the IMaP Context
The CRM Data Dictionary refers to a structured definition of data fields that must be captured, stored, and analysed within a CRM system to support the Sales Capability System. In the context of the IMaP3 project, the CRM Data Dictionary functions as a critical foundation for the digitalisation of sales processes, enabling systematic lead management and data-driven decision-making. It plays an important role in reducing the incidence of unconverted leads by ensuring that all customer interactions and lead attributes are recorded in a consistent and structured manner. In addition, the data dictionary supports customer profiling and market segmentation, allowing the organisation to better understand customer needs and behaviour. By integrating analytics and simulated AI-driven decision support at Technology Readiness Level 4, the CRM Data Dictionary contributes directly to enhancing sales effectiveness and organisational capability. The design of these data fields specifically addresses the core challenges faced by Jasmiza Solution Sdn. Bhd., including fragmented leads across multiple platforms, unsystematic follow-up processes, the absence of lead prioritisation mechanisms, and weak market segmentation.

2. Lead Information Fields
The Lead Information Fields capture essential and contextual data related to potential customers as soon as they interact with digital channels such as social media platforms, chatbots, or the company website. This set of data forms the foundational layer of the CRM system, ensuring that every lead is recorded in a structured and traceable manner. The LeadID is automatically generated by the system to provide a unique identifier for each lead, preventing data duplication and ensuring clarity in record management. The Full Name field records the identity of the individual or organisational representative, which is crucial for personalised engagement and relationship-building in the early stages of the sales process. The Contact Method field specifies the preferred communication channel, typically WhatsApp or email, allowing sales personnel to respond efficiently and reduce delays that often contribute to unconverted leads. Contact Details store the actual communication information, such as a phone number or email address, and serve as the foundation for follow-up activities and task automation within the CRM system. The Company Name field, although optional, is particularly important for business-to-business segmentation, as it enables the organisation to differentiate between individual clients, SMEs, and corporate customers and to analyse unpenetrated market segments more effectively.

Service Interest captures the specific service requested by the lead, such as personal coaching, in-house training, or competency diagnosis, allowing the organisation to adopt a needs-based selling approach rather than a generic sales strategy. This field supports more targeted service offerings in line with the objectives of IMaP3. The Urgency Level indicates the readiness of the lead to proceed, distinguishing between exploratory inquiries and urgent needs. This information is critical for lead prioritisation and serves as a key input for the lead scoring algorithm, enabling faster response times for high-value leads. The Lead Source field is automatically captured to identify where the lead originated, such as Instagram, Facebook Ads, TikTok, or direct website access. This data supports marketing performance analysis and helps the organisation evaluate the effectiveness of its digital channels. Referral Details allow the system to track leads generated through recommendations, which is particularly relevant for relationship-driven sales in the training and consultancy sector. Finally, the Landing Page URL records the specific webpage visited by the lead, enabling behavioural analytics and providing insights into customer intent and interest.

3. Chatbot Interaction Data
The Chatbot Interaction Data captures qualitative information derived from customer interactions with the chatbot, in alignment with the chatbot and AI components of the Sales Capability System. The Chat Transcript field automatically records the full conversation between the customer and the chatbot, preserving valuable contextual information related to customer needs, concerns, and expectations. This data can be used to analyse customer requirements, improve chatbot FAQ content, and serve as training data for more advanced AI functionalities in future development phases. The Date and Time Captured field records when the interaction occurred, supporting analysis of peak enquiry periods, response time performance, and service-level agreement compliance. Collectively, these fields strengthen the organisation’s ability to make data-driven sales decisions and reflect the IMaP3 emphasis on intelligent technology integration within CRM systems.

4. Lead Scoring and Profiling Data
The Lead Scoring and Profiling Data represent the core analytical component of the Sales Capability System. The Lead Score is a numeric value automatically calculated by the system based on factors such as urgency level, service interest, lead source, and chatbot engagement. This score provides an objective assessment of a lead’s conversion potential, enabling sales teams to focus their efforts on high-value opportunities and reduce inefficiencies in resource allocation. Complementing this, the Lead Segment field classifies leads into categories such as Hot, Warm, or Cold, offering an intuitive overview of lead quality and readiness. This segmentation supports differentiated follow-up strategies, appropriate communication tone, and more effective sales pipeline management. Through systematic scoring and segmentation, the CRM system directly addresses the challenges of unconverted leads, unserved customers, and unpenetrated market segments highlighted in the IMaP application.
 
Figure 5. 2: Multi-Channel Lead Capture and Chatbot-to-CRM Integration Architecture

The flow illustrates the end-to-end lead capture and data integration process within the Sales Capability System developed for JSSB. The process begins with multiple digital customer touchpoints, including WhatsApp, Facebook Ads, TikTok, Instagram, and the Jasmiza Website. These platforms represent the primary channels through which potential customers become aware of the company’s services and initiate initial contact. Each channel plays a role in generating leads with varying levels of interest, urgency, and intent, reflecting the diverse digital behaviour of modern customers.
All incoming interactions from these digital platforms are funnelled into the Jasmiza Chatbot, which acts as a centralised entry point for lead engagement. The chatbot functions as an automated first-line interface that standardises customer interaction regardless of the original source platform. By centralising interactions at the chatbot level, the system eliminates fragmentation in lead handling and ensures consistency in data capture. This design directly addresses the problem of leads being scattered across multiple platforms, which previously contributed to missed opportunities and inefficient follow-up. During the chatbot interaction, structured lead information is systematically collected from the potential customer. This includes essential identification and contextual data such as the customer’s full name, preferred contact method, company name (if applicable), service interest, and perceived lead urgency. In addition to these core fields, the chatbot may also capture other interaction-related information, such as responses to frequently asked questions (FAQs) or predefined prompts based on Jasmiza’s internal documentation. This ensures that both quantitative and qualitative data related to customer intent and needs are preserved from the earliest stage of engagement.

Once the interaction is completed, all captured data is automatically transmitted to the CRM database. The CRM database serves as the central repository for all lead-related information, enabling structured storage, retrieval, and analysis. At this stage, the data becomes available for downstream processes such as lead scoring, profiling, follow-up task generation, and sales pipeline tracking. By storing all lead data in a single CRM database, the organisation gains full visibility over customer interactions across channels and time, supporting data-driven decision-making and systematic sales management. Overall, this flow demonstrates how multi-channel digital lead sources are integrated through a chatbot-driven capture mechanism into a central CRM system. The design reflects the core principles of the IMaP3 Sales Capability System, namely centralised lead management, reduction of unconverted leads, improved responsiveness, and readiness for analytics and AI-supported decision-making.

Table 5. 3: CRM Sales Assignment, System, and Reporting Data Fields 

The figure presents the extended CRM Data Dictionary focusing on Sales Assignment Fields, System Fields, and Reporting (Derived) Fields, which collectively support operational execution, governance, and performance analysis within the Sales Capability System. These fields complement the lead capture and profiling components by ensuring that leads are not only recorded but also systematically managed, tracked, and evaluated throughout the sales lifecycle. The Sales Assignment Fields are designed to operationalise lead ownership, follow-up activities, and sales accountability. The AssignedSalesRepID field automatically links each lead to a specific sales representative, ensuring clear responsibility and preventing leads from being overlooked. This field is critical in transforming lead data into actionable sales tasks and supports coordinated sales execution. The FollowUpStatus field reflects the current stage of engagement with the lead, such as whether the lead is newly captured, already contacted, scheduled for follow-up, successfully converted, or lost. By standardising follow-up status categories, the system provides real-time visibility of lead progression across the sales pipeline. The FollowUpDate field records the planned or system-generated follow-up date, supporting structured scheduling and reducing reliance on manual reminders. This ensures timely engagement and directly addresses the issue of inconsistent follow-up highlighted in the IMaP3 problem context. The SalesNotes field allows sales representatives to record qualitative insights, observations, and contextual information gained during interactions, enriching the CRM database with human judgment that complements system-generated analytics.

The System Fields function as governance and audit mechanisms within the CRM architecture. The CreatedBy field records the system user responsible for creating the lead record, while the CreatedDate field automatically captures the timestamp of record creation. Together, these fields ensure traceability and transparency in data entry. The LastModifiedBy and LastModifiedDate fields track subsequent updates to the lead record, enabling version control and accountability over data changes. These system-generated fields are essential for maintaining data integrity, supporting audit requirements, and ensuring consistency across the Sales Capability System, particularly within an applied research and prototype validation context.

The Reporting (Derived) Fields are analytically driven fields that are calculated or auto-mapped by the system to support performance monitoring and managerial decision-making. The DaysSinceCaptured field calculates the number of days elapsed since a lead was first recorded, providing a clear indicator of lead ageing and responsiveness. This metric is especially useful for identifying delayed follow-ups that may increase the risk of lead loss. The InteractionCount field aggregates the total number of interactions, including chatbot engagements and human follow-ups, offering insight into engagement intensity and sales effort. Higher or lower interaction counts can be analysed in relation to conversion outcomes, supporting continuous process improvement. The CampaignName field, when available, is automatically mapped from advertising data and links leads to specific marketing campaigns. This enables campaign-level performance analysis and supports evaluation of digital marketing effectiveness.

Overall, this set of fields strengthens the Sales Capability System by bridging operational sales activities with system governance and analytical reporting. By integrating sales assignment, audit control, and derived performance metrics into a single CRM structure, the system moves beyond basic data storage toward a comprehensive, analytics-enabled capability. This design aligns with the objectives of IMaP3 by supporting structured sales execution, reducing unconverted leads, enhancing managerial oversight, and enabling data-driven decision-making at Technology Readiness Level 4.

Table 5. 4: CRM Lead Scoring Rules and AI Profiling Suggestions

The CRM Lead Scoring Rules and AI Profiling Suggestions define the analytical logic used to evaluate, prioritise, and classify leads within the Sales Capability System. This scoring framework transforms raw lead data into actionable intelligence by assigning weighted scores based on predefined behavioural, contextual, and engagement-related criteria. The objective of this mechanism is to support data-driven sales decision-making, reduce unconverted leads, and ensure that sales resources are focused on leads with the highest conversion potential, in line with the objectives.

Lead source is treated as a critical indicator of lead intent and quality within the scoring framework. Leads originating from paid digital advertising platforms such as Instagram Ads, Facebook Ads, and TikTok Ads are assigned a higher score, reflecting stronger commercial intent and higher acquisition cost. These leads are typically categorised as high-priority or “Hot” leads due to their demonstrated interest through targeted campaigns. In contrast, leads that arrive through direct website visits are assigned a moderate score, recognising their interest while acknowledging that they may still be in the early stages of consideration. This differentiation enables the organisation to assess the effectiveness of marketing channels and prioritise follow-up efforts accordingly.

Urgency level is another key determinant in the lead scoring model, as it directly reflects the readiness of a potential customer to make a purchasing decision. Leads that indicate an urgent need are awarded the highest score, signalling immediate sales opportunities that require prompt attention. Leads that are planning to buy receive a moderate score, indicating future potential that should be nurtured systematically. Meanwhile, leads categorised as “just curious” receive a lower score, as they typically represent exploratory interest rather than immediate buying intent. By incorporating urgency into the scoring logic, the system ensures timely responses to high-value leads and reduces delays that often contribute to lead attrition.

Service interest further refines the scoring process by accounting for the strategic value and complexity of different offerings. In-house training services receive a higher score due to their organisational scale, longer engagement cycles, and higher revenue potential. Competency diagnosis services are also assigned a strong score, reflecting their consultative nature and potential to lead to extended engagements. Personal coaching services receive a moderate score, recognising their importance while acknowledging their typically smaller scope. This differentiation supports needs-based selling and aligns sales efforts with services that contribute more significantly to sustainable business growth.
Additional contextual indicators are incorporated to enhance the robustness of the scoring model. The provision of a company name adds to the lead score, as it signals organisational affiliation and increases the likelihood of business-to-business engagement. Chat interaction length is also used as a proxy for customer engagement, with longer chatbot conversations indicating deeper interest, clearer intent, or more complex needs. Leads with extended interactions are therefore scored higher, as they present richer opportunities for conversion through personalised follow-up. Furthermore, sales responsiveness is recognised as a contributing factor, with leads receiving additional points when sales representatives respond within 24 hours. This reinforces the importance of timely follow-up and embeds service quality considerations into the analytical framework.

The cumulative lead score derived from these criteria is mapped into predefined lead score bands to simplify interpretation and support operational decision-making. Leads with low cumulative scores are classified as “Cold,” indicating low immediate conversion potential and suitability for low-intensity nurturing. Leads with moderate scores are classified as “Warm,” representing prospects that require structured engagement and follow-up. High-scoring leads are categorised as “Hot,” signalling strong conversion potential and priority for immediate sales action. This classification enables intuitive pipeline management and ensures alignment between analytical outputs and sales execution.

Overall, the CRM Lead Scoring Rules and AI Profiling Suggestions provide a structured and transparent mechanism for transforming lead data into strategic insight. By combining lead source, urgency, service interest, engagement behaviour, and sales responsiveness, the system supports intelligent prioritisation and consistent decision-making. This analytics-driven approach reflects the core principles of the Sales Capability System by enhancing efficiency, reducing reliance on subjective judgment, and preparing the foundation for more advanced AI-driven optimisation in future development phases.

Table 5. 5: CRM User Role Access Matrix

The CRM User Role Access Matrix defines how different users interact with the Sales Capability System by allocating system access according to functional responsibilities and organisational hierarchy. This role-based access control mechanism ensures that the CRM system supports operational efficiency while maintaining data security, accountability, and governance. By differentiating access rights across roles, the system prevents unauthorised modifications, reduces operational risks, and aligns system usage with real-world sales and marketing workflows.

The Admin role represents the highest level of system authority and is responsible for overall system governance and configuration. Admin users are granted full access across all CRM modules, including dashboard overview, lead capture settings, lead lists and details, lead assignment to sales representatives, follow-up task management, chatbot configuration, reporting dashboards, AI profiling results, user management, system settings, and data export or import functions. This comprehensive access enables the Admin to manage system architecture, control data integrity, configure automation rules, and ensure the CRM system operates in accordance with organisational objectives. Within JSSB context, the Admin role is essential for prototype configuration, system testing, and validation of functional capabilities at Technology Readiness Level 4.

The Sales Manager role is designed to support sales supervision, performance monitoring, and resource coordination without granting full system control. Sales Managers have full access to dashboards, lead lists, lead details, lead assignment, follow-up task management, reporting dashboards, and AI profiling results. This level of access allows them to oversee the sales pipeline, evaluate lead quality, prioritise opportunities, and make informed decisions based on analytical insights. However, access to system-level configurations such as user management, system settings, and data import functions is restricted or limited to view-only. This separation of duties ensures that strategic oversight can be exercised without compromising system stability or governance.

The Sales Representative role focuses on execution and customer engagement. Sales Representatives are granted access only to leads that have been explicitly assigned to them, reinforcing accountability and ownership over customer interactions. They are permitted to view dashboards, access assigned lead lists, and view or edit lead details related to their assignments. Follow-up task management is similarly restricted to assigned leads, ensuring that sales activities are structured and traceable. Sales Representatives are provided with view-only access to reports and AI profiling outputs, allowing them to understand lead prioritisation and recommended actions without altering analytical logic. They do not have access to lead assignment, chatbot settings, system configurations, or data export functions, ensuring their role remains operational rather than administrative.

The Marketing Team role is structured to support campaign monitoring, lead generation analysis, and performance reporting rather than direct sales execution. Marketing users are granted view-only access to dashboards, lead lists, lead details, and chatbot settings, enabling them to analyse lead inflow patterns and customer engagement behaviour across digital channels. They are also allowed to view and export selected reporting data, particularly lead-related information, to support campaign evaluation and optimisation. However, they do not have access to lead assignment, follow-up task management, AI profiling results, or system settings, ensuring a clear boundary between marketing analytics and sales operations.
Within the IMaP3 implementation scope, particularly at Technology Readiness Level 4, the system prototype provides only a single user role, typically the Admin role, for demonstration and validation purposes. This constraint aligns with TRL 4 requirements, which emphasise functional validation in a controlled environment rather than full organisational deployment. Nevertheless, the inclusion of a comprehensive User Role Access Matrix demonstrates the system’s readiness for scalability and real-world adoption in future development phases.

In summary, the CRM User Role Access Matrix establishes a structured and secure framework for system usage within the Sales Capability System. By aligning access rights with organisational roles, the design enhances operational efficiency, strengthens governance, and supports data-driven sales management. This role-based architecture directly contributes to the IMaP3 objectives by enabling systematic sales execution, reducing unconverted leads, and reinforcing the transformation from individual sales competency to organisational sales capability.








5.4.3 Admin View- Sales Capability system- Pulse Track Customer
 
Figure 5. 3: Admin View- Sales Capability system- Pulse Track Customer (Step 1) 

The Admin View of the Sales Capability System, labelled as Pulse Track Customer, represents the central control interface through which system administrators monitor, manage, and analyse customer leads across the entire sales process. This view is designed to provide holistic visibility of lead activities, service interests, and engagement patterns, enabling effective governance and data-driven oversight in line with the objectives. The interaction begins at the login interface, where the Admin user authenticates access using a username and password. This login mechanism ensures system security and restricts access to authorised personnel only. Within the IMaP3 prototype context, a single Admin role is implemented to validate system functionality at Technology Readiness Level 4. This controlled access environment allows the system to be tested, demonstrated, and evaluated without exposing configuration settings to multiple users.

Upon successful login, the Admin is presented with a dashboard comprising multiple functional tabs, including the Leads Tab, Leads Scoring, Leads Analytics, and Salesperson Tab. These tabs reflect the core modules of the Sales Capability System and allow the Admin to switch between operational monitoring, analytical assessment, and resource oversight. The Leads Tab serves as the primary interface for viewing and organising incoming leads, while the Leads Scoring and Leads Analytics tabs provide insights into lead quality, prioritisation, and performance trends. The Salesperson Tab supports monitoring of sales resource allocation and engagement effectiveness.

Within the Leads Tab, the system displays a structured list of leads categorised by service type, such as Personal Coaching, In-House Training, and Competency Diagnosis. This categorisation enables the Admin to assess demand patterns across different services and identify which offerings attract the highest level of customer interest. In parallel, leads can also be viewed by individual names, allowing direct access to specific customer records. This dual-view design enhances usability and supports both strategic analysis and operational inspection. The Leads Information section presents detailed customer data captured through digital channels and chatbot interactions. This includes essential fields such as full name, preferred contact method, company name, service interest, and lead urgency. In addition, the system records other interaction details derived from frequently asked questions based on Jasmiza’s internal documentation. By consolidating both structured and contextual data in a single interface, the Admin can obtain a comprehensive understanding of each lead’s intent, readiness, and engagement history.
Overall, the Admin View,  Pulse Track Customer demonstrates how the Sales Capability System integrates lead capture, categorisation, scoring, and analysis into a unified dashboard. This design supports centralised lead management, reduces fragmentation of customer data, and strengthens analytical oversight. In the context of IMaP3 and TRL 4 validation, the Admin View serves as a functional prototype that illustrates the system’s ability to transform dispersed digital interactions into structured, actionable sales intelligence, thereby reinforcing the transition from individual sales competency to organizational sales capability.
 
Figure 5. 4: Admin View- Sales Capability system- Pulse Track Customer (Step 2)

The figure illustrates the integrated workflow of lead scoring, salesperson assignment, and lead status management within the Sales Capability System. This workflow demonstrates how raw lead data is transformed into structured, actionable intelligence through rule-based analytics and controlled administrative intervention. The process begins with the application of predefined lead scoring rules, where each lead is evaluated based on multiple criteria such as lead source, urgency level, service interest, company information, interaction length, and response time. These criteria are assigned weighted score values that collectively determine the overall lead score. The scoring logic is rule-based, ensuring transparency and consistency in how leads are evaluated across the system.

Based on the cumulative score generated from these rules, each lead is automatically classified into a score band, namely Cold, Warm, or Hot. This classification simplifies interpretation and enables immediate prioritisation of leads according to their conversion potential. Cold leads typically represent low immediacy or exploratory interest, Warm leads indicate moderate intent requiring structured follow-up, while Hot leads signal strong readiness for engagement and potential conversion. This automated segmentation reduces reliance on subjective judgment and supports data-driven decision-making, which is a core objective of the IMaP3 Sales Capability System. Once the lead score band has been determined, the system allows the Admin to assign the lead to a specific salesperson using a dropdown selection mechanism. This assignment step ensures clear ownership and accountability for each lead while enabling the Admin to balance workload and align salesperson expertise with service type. The assignment process bridges analytical outputs and operational execution, ensuring that high-priority leads are promptly directed to appropriate sales personnel.

Following assignment, the lead status is dynamically managed within the system. Lead status values such as New, Contacted, Follow-Up Scheduled, Converted, and Lost are updated automatically based on inputs provided by the assigned salesperson through a dropdown menu. This design ensures that lead progression through the sales pipeline is consistently recorded and reflected in real time. By automating status updates based on user actions, the system maintains accurate pipeline visibility while minimising manual data entry errors.

The workflow is presented within a unified interface that displays key lead attributes, including customer name, selected service, score band, assigned salesperson, and current lead status. The inclusion of edit and save functions allows controlled updates while preserving data integrity. This consolidated view enables both monitoring and intervention, supporting effective sales management and continuous performance tracking. Overall, this workflow demonstrates how the Sales Capability System integrates rule-based analytics, administrative control, and salesperson execution into a coherent process. By linking lead scoring rules with assignment logic and automated status updates, the system operationalises the transition from data capture to sales action. Within the IMaP3 and TRL 4 context, this prototype validates the system’s capability to reduce unconverted leads, improve follow-up discipline, and strengthen organisational sales capability through structured, analytics-enabled workflows.
 
Figure 5. 5: Admin View- Sales Capability system- Pulse Track Customer (Step 3)

The Salesperson Tab represents the operational execution layer of the Sales Capability System, where assigned sales representatives manage and update their respective leads. This interface is designed to ensure that sales activities are structured, traceable, and aligned with the analytical outputs generated by the CRM system. By restricting the view to leads assigned to a specific salesperson, the system reinforces accountability and supports focused customer engagement. At the top of the interface, the Salesperson Name field identifies the logged-in sales representative, in this case indicating the user “Nazrul.” This contextual identification ensures that all displayed leads are filtered according to ownership, preventing access to unassigned leads and maintaining data security. Such role-based filtering aligns with the access control principles defined in the CRM User Role Access Matrix.

Within the main table, the system displays a structured list of leads assigned to the salesperson. Each record includes the lead’s name, the type of service requested, the lead score band, the current lead status, and an area for sales notes. The service column provides immediate context regarding customer needs, such as competency diagnosis, enabling the salesperson to tailor communication and engagement strategies. The score band, categorised as Cold or Hot, reflects the output of the system’s rule-based lead scoring mechanism and guides the salesperson in prioritising effort and response intensity. The lead status column captures the current stage of engagement, such as New or Follow-Up, and reflects progression through the sales pipeline. This status is updated by the salesperson based on actual interaction outcomes, ensuring that the CRM database accurately represents real-time sales activity. The inclusion of a sales notes field allows the salesperson to document qualitative insights, follow-up outcomes, or customer-specific considerations. These notes enrich the system with contextual knowledge that complements quantitative analytics and supports continuity in customer engagement.
The presence of Edit and Save functions enables controlled updates to lead records while preserving data integrity. Sales representatives may modify lead status and notes based on ongoing interactions, but they do not have access to system-level configurations or lead assignment functions. This design ensures that the Salesperson Tab remains execution-focused, reducing complexity and supporting efficient workflow management. Overall, the Salesperson Tab demonstrates how the Sales Capability System operationalises analytics-driven insights at the individual user level. By integrating lead scoring, status tracking, and qualitative documentation within a single interface, the system supports disciplined follow-up, reduces the likelihood of unconverted leads, and strengthens organisational sales capability. Within the IMaP3 and TRL 4 context, this interface validates the system’s ability to translate analytical intelligence into consistent and accountable sales actions.
 
Figure 5. 6: Admin View- Sales Capability system- Pulse Track Customer (Step 4)

This dashboard is designed to support data-driven decision-making by transforming operational lead data into meaningful performance indicators that can be easily interpreted by system administrators and sales managers.

The dashboard allows users to filter and analyse lead data based on key dimensions such as year, type of service, and assigned salesperson. In the illustrated example, the data is filtered for the year 2025, the service category of Personal Coaching, and a specific salesperson. These filtering options enable targeted analysis, allowing management to assess performance trends at different levels of granularity, whether by time period, service offering, or individual sales representative. Such flexibility is particularly important for identifying patterns related to demand, sales effectiveness, and resource allocation.

At the centre of the dashboard, the total number of leads is prominently displayed, providing an immediate overview of sales activity volume within the selected parameters. This high-level metric serves as a starting point for further analysis and helps management gauge the scale of engagement for specific services or sales personnel. By contextualising this figure with additional breakdowns, the dashboard supports a more nuanced understanding of performance beyond simple lead counts. A key feature of the dashboard is the Lead Status Summary table, which categorises leads according to their current stage in the sales pipeline, including New, Follow-Up, Contacted, Converted, and Lost. Each status is accompanied by a corresponding count, offering clear visibility into pipeline distribution and conversion progress. This breakdown allows users to identify bottlenecks, such as a high number of leads remaining in the “New” or “Follow-Up” stages, which may signal delays in engagement or follow-up inefficiencies. Conversely, the number of converted leads provides a direct indicator of sales effectiveness, while lost leads highlight areas requiring process improvement or strategy adjustment.
Overall, the Leads Analytics Dashboard functions as a critical decision-support tool within the Sales Capability System. By consolidating lead data into structured, interpretable metrics, the dashboard enhances managerial oversight, supports continuous performance monitoring, and enables evidence-based adjustments to sales strategies. Within the IMaP3 and Technology Readiness Level 4 context, this dashboard validates the system’s capability to generate actionable insights from CRM data, reinforcing the transition from manual, intuition-driven sales management to an analytics-enabled organisational sales capability.

First, the project supports national digital transformation initiatives by promoting the adoption of CRM, analytics, and AI-driven systems within SMEs. Digitalisation of sales operations enhances productivity, competitiveness, and resilience, which are critical factors for sustainable economic growth.

Second, the project contributes to SME capability development, a key priority in Malaysia’s economic agenda. By strengthening sales capability, SMEs are better positioned to penetrate new markets, improve revenue generation, and create employment opportunities. Third, the project reinforces the role of higher education institutions as drivers of innovation and industry development. Through applied research and system development, universities contribute directly to addressing industry challenges, thereby enhancing the return on public investment in higher education. Overall, the project demonstrates how IMaP funded initiatives can deliver measurable outcomes that benefit industry, academia, and the nation, supporting MOHE’s vision of a dynamic, innovation-driven higher education ecosystem.
6.5 System Scalability
An important consideration arising from this project is the scalability of the Sales Capability System. The system was intentionally designed using a modular architecture, enabling future expansion and enhancement without significant redesign. This modularity supports scalability across several dimensions. At the organizational level, the system can accommodate increased sales volume, additional users, and more complex workflows as the business grows. New modules or functionalities can be integrated to support advanced analytics, automated decision-making, or integration with other enterprise systems.

At the technological level, the current TRL 4 prototype provides a foundation for progression to higher TRL levels. With further development, testing, and deployment in a live operational environment, the system can evolve towards TRL 5 and beyond. Advanced AI algorithms, machine learning-based prediction models, and deeper system integration represent potential future enhancements. At the industry level, the system architecture is sufficiently generic to be adapted for use by other SMEs operating in similar service-oriented sectors. This scalability enhances the broader impact potential of the project and supports future commercialization or replication initiatives.

6.6 Recommendations for Improvement
Based on the findings and discussion, several recommendations are proposed to enhance the effectiveness and impact of the Sales Capability System. First, future development should focus on advancing AI functionalities, including predictive lead scoring, automated recommendation engines, and real-time performance optimization. Second, integration with additional digital platforms such as accounting systems, customer service tools, and learning management systems could enhance system value and support end-to-end organizational capability development. Third, user training and change management initiatives are recommended to ensure effective system adoption. While technology provides the infrastructure, sustained impact depends on user engagement, organizational culture, and leadership support. Finally, longitudinal evaluation is recommended to assess the long-term impact of the system on sales performance, customer satisfaction, and organizational growth. Such evaluation would provide valuable insights for continuous improvement and inform future policy and funding decisions under IMaP.
