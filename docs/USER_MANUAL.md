### 8.7 Reminder Best Practices

**Tips for effective reminder usage:**

1. **Use descriptive titles**: "Review Q4 budget proposal" is better than "Review file"
2. **Set appropriate priorities**: Reserve "High" for truly urgent items
3. **Add context in notes**: Include what action needs to be taken
4. **Use recurring reminders**: For regular tasks like monthly reports
5. **Check daily**: Review your To-Do Documents each morning
6. **Complete or dismiss**: Keep your list clean by acting on reminders

**Common Use Cases:**

- **Contract reviews**: Set reminders before contract expiration dates
- **Report submissions**: Never miss a deadline
- **Document approvals**: Track pending approvals
- **Regular reviews**: Monthly/quarterly document reviews
- **Follow-ups**: Remind yourself to follow up on shared documents
