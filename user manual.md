6.8	File Versioning

Task Insight DMS automatically tracks file versions when you upload a new version of an existing file. This allows you to access and restore previous versions of your documents.

How Versioning Works:

Automatic Version Creation:
-	When you upload a file with the same name as an existing file, a new version is created
-	Previous versions are preserved automatically
-	Each version maintains its upload date, uploader information, and file size

2. Select "Manage versions" from the context menu
3. The version history modal will open

Method 2: From File Information

Delete Version (Admin Only):
-	Organization admins can delete old versions to save storage space
-	Deleting a version is permanent and cannot be undone

Version Best Practices:
-	Review version history before restoring to ensure you're selecting the correct version
-	Important: Restoring a version replaces the current version, but previous versions remain available
-	Use version notes (if available) to document changes in each version

7. 	Folder Management
7.1	Navigating Folders
- Double-click a folder to open it
- Use the “breadcrumb” at the top to navigate back

Accessing Trash:

To view deleted items:
1. Click "Trash" in the sidebar navigation
2. All deleted files and folders will be displayed
3. Deleted items show their original location and deletion date

-	The recovery period may vary based on organization settings

Restoring Items from Trash:

Method 1: Restore to Original Location
1. Go to "Trash" in the sidebar

1. Go to "Trash" in the sidebar
2. Click "Empty Trash" button (if available)
3. Confirm the action

-	Only the file owner or organization admin can permanently delete items from Trash
